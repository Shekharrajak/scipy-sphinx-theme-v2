NumPy
=====


NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
It contains among other things:

- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient
multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be
defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide
variety of databases.

NumPy is licensed under the :ref:`BSD license <license>`, enabling reuse with
few restrictions.
